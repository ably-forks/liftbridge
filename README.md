Liftbridge provides lightweight, fault-tolerant message streams by implementing
a durable stream augmentation for the [NATS messaging system](https://nats.io).
It extends NATS with a Kafka-like publish-subscribe log API that is highly
available and horizontally scalable. Use Liftbridge as a simpler and lighter
alternative to systems like Kafka and Pulsar or use it to add streaming
semantics to an existing NATS deployment.

See the [introduction](https://bravenewgeek.com/introducing-liftbridge-lightweight-fault-tolerant-message-streams/)
post on Liftbridge and [this post](https://bravenewgeek.com/building-a-distributed-log-from-scratch-part-5-sketching-a-new-system/)
for more context and some of the inspiration behind it.
